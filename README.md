this project I learned to build a basic website using Flexbox.
given a stylesheet  (click here for stylesheet)[https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png] i had to design a websit close to the stylesheet above.

I learned the importance flexbox to aligning, items. some problems I faced were tweking an aligned image a little more than what flex provided.
